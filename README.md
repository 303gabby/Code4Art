# ðŸŒ± Creative Coding with p5.js
p5.js was the first tool I ever used to code something creative. Before that, coding felt rigid and logical, but p5.js helped me see how code could be playful, expressive, and visual. It became a way for me to design quirky characters and experiment without needing to be perfect.

I keep coming back to this platform every now and then, usually in my spare time, to see how much I have grown. Some sketches are just silly ideas I needed to get out of my head. Others helped me learn concepts like randomness, interactivity, or animation in a hands-on way.

This collection is like a visual journal of my coding journey.

Hope you enjoy exploring it as much as I enjoyed making it ðŸ’«
